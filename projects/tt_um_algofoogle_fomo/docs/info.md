## How it works

For now it just generates basic VGA video timing and generates some crappy noise patterns.

Later, it might be a totally different project!

## How to test

Supply the usual 25.175MHz clock and use a Tiny VGA PMOD.

## External hardware

Tiny VGA PMOD is all you really need for now.
