## How it works

silly2 creates divide by 2 clk signals, silly1 allows user to pick which signals get outputed.

## How to test

Apply various signals onto the inputs and see what comes out the outputs. Outputs should be the 
appropriately divide by 2 clock.

## External hardware

Use FPGA to drive and read signal outputs.
