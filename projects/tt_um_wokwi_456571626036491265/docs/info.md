## How it works
Several gates are connected to 6 input pins.

## How to test

Set inputs 0 1 3 4 6 7 and check the output expected result
-----------------------------------------------------------
Input 0 -> 1 
Input 1 -> 0
Input 3 -> 1
Input 4 -> 1
Input 6 -> 1
Input 7 -> 0

The AND, OR, NAND and XOR gate should output 1.
