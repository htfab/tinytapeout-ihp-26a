## How it works

An All-Digital Phase-Locked Loop (ADPLL).

```
clk_ref ──►[Bang-Bang PD]──► early/late ──►[Loop Filter]──► freq_ctrl[6:0]
                ▲                        (up/down counter)           │
                │                                                    ▼
           [Divider /8] ◄── dco_clk ◄─────────────────────────[Ring Osc DCO] ──► clk_pll_o
```

The bang-bang phase detector compares the divided DCO output against the reference clock. If the DCO is too fast, the loop filter decrements `freq_ctrl` (adding delay stages, slowing the DCO). If too slow, it increments. At lock, `freq_ctrl` dithers by +/-1 around the target value.

### Target specs
- Reference clock: 5-10 MHz
- DCO range: ~300-600 MHz (7-stage ring oscillator)
- Output clock: ~40-75 MHz (with /8 divider)

See README.md for more details.

## How to test

The PLL will start to lock onto the input reference clock after reset is deasserted.

The generated PLL can be measured on output pin uo[0].

  uo[0]: "clk_pll_o"
  uo[1]: "locked_o"
  uo[2]: "clk_ref_o"

The clock frequency is adjusted by a 7-bit control that can be read on the bi-dir pins for debugging:

  uio[0]: "freq_ctrl_o[0]"
  uio[1]: "freq_ctrl_o[1]"
  uio[2]: "freq_ctrl_o[2]"
  uio[3]: "freq_ctrl_o[3]"
  uio[4]: "freq_ctrl_o[4]"
  uio[5]: "freq_ctrl_o[5]"
  uio[6]: "freq_ctrl_o[6]"


## External hardware

Oscilloscope nedded for measuring output frequency.
