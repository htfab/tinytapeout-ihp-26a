## How it works

Connect the rotary encoder to input A ("A_in") and input B ("B_in"). The output will then be a debounced signal to used with i.e. a counter, having clk & up/down on output 1 & 2 respectively.  

## How to test

Connect to input 1+2, check output 1+2

## External hardware

Rotary encoder - preferribly one from an Arduino set.
